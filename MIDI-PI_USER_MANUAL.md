## Channel Settings

Per-channel MIDI configuration. Access: Press MODE from playback screen.

**Display:**
```
CH. [SAVE] [DEL]     Pa:64
Ch: 1  M:OF  S:OF  Tr: +0
P:--  Ve:--  Vo:100
```

**Options:**
- **[SAVE]** - Save settings to `.cfg` file (LEFT/RIGHT for YES/NO, OK to confirm)
- **[DEL]** - Delete `.cfg` file and revert to defaults
- **Ch: 1** - Select channel (1-16)
- **M:OF** - Mute status (OF=unmuted, ON=muted)
- **S:OF** - Solo status (OF=not solo, ON=solo). When any channel is solo, all non-solo channels are muted
- **Tr: +0** - Transpose in semitones (-24 to +24, 0=no transpose)
- **P:--** - Program/Instrument (--=MIDI file default, 0-127=override)
- **Ve:--** - Per-channel velocity scale (--=use global, 1-200, 100=normal)
- **Vo:100** - Volume (--=MIDI default, 0-127=set level)
- **Pa:64** - Pan (--=MIDI default, 0=left, 64=center, 127=right)

**Settings Saved:**
All 16 channels: mutes, programs, pan, volume, and global velocity

**Override Behavior:**
When you set a value other than "--", your setting overrides the MIDI file. The file's Program Change, CC7 (Volume), and CC10 (Pan) messages are ignored.

---

## Track Settings

Global track configuration. Access: Press MODE from Channel Settings.

**Display:**
```
TRCK [SAVE] [DEL]
BPM:120  Ve:50
SysEx: ON
```

**Options:**
- **[SAVE]** - Save all settings (channel + track) to `.cfg` file
- **[DEL]** - Delete `.cfg` file
- **BPM** - Adjust tempo ±1 BPM
- **Ve** - Global velocity (1-100, 50=normal)
- **SysEx** - Enable/disable System Exclusive messages (ON/OFF)

**Velocity Hierarchy:**
- **Global Velocity (Ve)** - Affects all notes on all channels (1-100, 50=normal)
- **Per-Channel Velocity (Ch. Ve)** - Multiplies global velocity per channel (--=use global, 1-200, 100=normal)
- **Volume (Vo)** - Per-channel CC7 volume control (--=MIDI default, 0-127)

**Use Cases:**
- Use **Global Velocity** to balance loud/quiet tracks overall
- Use **Per-Channel Velocity** to adjust instrument balance within a song
- Use **Volume** to set fixed volume levels per channel

**SysEx Messages:**
System Exclusive (SysEx) messages are device-specific MIDI commands. Some MIDI files (especially MT-32 game soundtracks) contain SysEx messages that change instrument parameters like tuning or patch settings.

**When to Disable SysEx:**
- If a file causes detuning or weird sounds that persist between songs
- If you want to prevent device-specific modifications
- When using a different synth than the file was designed for

**Note:** SysEx is enabled by default. Disable only if experiencing issues.

## MIDI Settings

MIDI input configuration. Access: Press MODE from Track Settings.

**Display:**
```
MIDI IN
Thru:      [OFF]
Keyboard:  [OFF]
Kbd Ch:      1
Kbd V:      50
```

**Options:**
- **Thru** - Pass MIDI input to output (ON/OFF)
- **Keyboard** - Enable keyboard mode (ON/OFF)
- **Kbd Ch** - Keyboard channel (1-16, active when Keyboard=ON)
- **Kbd V** - Keyboard velocity scaling (1-100, 50=normal, active when Keyboard=ON)

**Note:** Thru and Keyboard modes are mutually exclusive.

---

## Clock Settings

MIDI Clock output configuration. Access: Press MODE from MIDI Settings.

**Display:**
```
MIDI CLOCK
Enabled:   [OFF]
```

**Option:**
- **Enabled** - Send MIDI Clock/Start/Stop/Continue messages (ON/OFF)

**Behavior (when enabled):**
- Sends 24 clock pulses per quarter note during playback
- Sends Start when playing from beginning
- Sends Stop when stopped
- Sends Continue when resuming from pause

---

## Visualizer

Real-time 16-channel activity display. Access: Press MODE from Clock Settings.

**Display:**
```
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
█  ▆  █  ▄     ▂  █  ▅
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
▃     █  ▆  ▂     ▄  █
```

**What It Shows:**
- 16 columns (channels 1-16)
- Bar height = note activity (scaled by velocity × expression)
- Peak indicator = highest recent activity (holds briefly with decay)
- Animated bubbles = rising through active bars for visual interest
- Baseline markers = channel position reference

**Animation:**
The visualizer features animated bubbles that float upward through active channel bars. Each channel has 2 bubbles at different speeds, creating a dynamic visual effect that helps distinguish active channels.

**Use Cases:**
- Verify file playback
- Identify active channels
- Troubleshoot silent channels
- Visual feedback during setup
- Monitor channel activity and expression changes in real-time

**Note:** Channel 10 typically represents drums/percussion in General MIDI.

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound
1. Check MIDI cable connections
2. Verify channel isn't muted (M:OF = unmuted)
3. Check visualizer - do bars appear?
4. Verify volume (Vo) isn't 0
5. Delete `.cfg` file and reload

### Stuck Notes
- Press PANIC button
- Check MIDI cable quality
- Verify synth receives on correct channels

### File Won't Load
- Ensure file is in `/MIDI` folder
- Check extension is `.mid` or `.midi`
- Use shorter filename
- Verify SD card is FAT32

### Settings Not Saving
- Ensure SD card isn't write-protected
- Check free space
- Try different SD card
- Avoid special characters in filenames

### Fast Forward/Rewind Issues
- Slower on very long files (50,000 event limit per seek)
- Device pauses during seeking to prevent MIDI errors

## Tips & Tricks

**Fast Navigation:**
- PLAY from file browser loads and plays immediately
- Hold MODE 2s to jump to playback screen from anywhere
- Use NXT mode for continuous playback
- Use LPA mode for background music

**Balancing Tracks:**
- Use Velocity (Ve) to balance loud/quiet tracks (try 30-40 for loud, 60-70 for quiet)
- Save settings per-file for consistent playback

**Creating Custom Mixes:**
- Mute channels for karaoke tracks
- Adjust Volume (Vo) to balance instruments
- Use Pan to create stereo image
- Use program to change instruments for individual tracks (If your sound device supports it.)

**Tempo Control:**
- Use TAP tempo for quick BPM matching (great for live performance)
- Tap along with a metronome or reference track
- Fine-tune with BPM option after tapping
- Tempo changes are temporary (not saved to config)
- STOP + PLAY reloads and resets tempo
- Hold OK 2s on BPM to reset to 100%

**Advanced Mixing:**
- Use Solo (S) to isolate channels while mixing
- Use Transpose (Tr) to fix out-of-range notes or create harmonies
- Use Per-Channel Velocity to balance loud/quiet instruments
- Use Routing to merge multiple channels to one output

**SysEx Issues:**
- If synth sounds wrong after a file, disable SysEx for that file
- SysEx settings are saved per-file
- MT-32/SC-55 users: Some game soundtracks include instrument patches via SysEx

**Testing Changes:**
- Use visualizer to verify activity and expression changes
- Watch for bubble animation to confirm channel activity
- PANIC silences stuck notes
- STOP + PLAY reloads `.cfg` settings
